## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a configuration file:
   ```
   cp config.json.example config.json
   ```
4. Edit the `config.json` file to add your IRC server details

## Configuration

The `config.json` file contains all the settings for the bot:

- `irc`: Configuration for IRC networks
  - Each network has its own configuration with:
    - `host`: IRC server hostname
    - `port`: IRC server port (usually 6667 for plain, 6697 for SSL)

    - `username`: IRC username
    - `realname`: IRC realname/gecos
    - `password`: Server password (if required)
    - `sasl`: SASL authentication settings (if required)
    - `rateLimit`: Rate limiting settings
      - `messages`: Number of messages allowed in a period
      - `period`: Time period in milliseconds
    - `channels`: Array of channels to join
      - Simple format: `"#channel"`
      - Advanced format: `{"#channel": {options}}`
        - `autoJoin`: Whether to join this channel (boolean)
        - `ignoredNicks`: Array of usernames to ignore
        - `commandBlacklist`: Array of commands not allowed in this channel

See `config.json.example` for a complete example.

## Required API Keys

To use the weather and geocoding features, you'll need to obtain the following API keys:

1. **PirateWeather API**: A free alternative to the Dark Sky API
   - Visit [pirateweather.net](https://pirateweather.net/) to learn more
   - Register and obtain your API key

2. **Google Maps Geocoding API**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or use an existing one
   - Enable the Geocoding API
   - Create an API key restricted to the Geocoding API

You'll need to provide these API keys when using the weather tools.

## Usage

1. Set your Anthropic API key:
   ```
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

2. Run the bot:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   Or with a specific config file:
   ```
   npm start -- /path/to/config.json
   ```

## Commands

In IRC channels, the bot responds when mentioned directly:

- `coolbot: What's the weather like?`
- `coolbot, tell me a joke`
- `coolbot help me with this problem`

In private messages, you can talk to the bot directly without prefixing your messages.

### Weather Examples

The bot now supports weather lookups. Some examples:

- `coolbot: What's the weather like in San Francisco?`
- `coolbot: Tell me the weather forecast for New York City`
- `coolbot: How hot is it in Tokyo right now?`

### GitHub Gist Examples

The bot can retrieve and display content from GitHub Gists:

- `coolbot: Show me the code in this gist: https://gist.github.com/username/abc123`
- `coolbot: Can you look at this gist and explain what it does? https://gist.github.com/username/abc123`
- `coolbot: What files are in this multi-file gist? https://gist.github.com/username/abc123`

## Available Tools

### Weather and Geocoding

The bot includes several tools for weather and location information:

1. **geolocate** - Convert a location name to geographic coordinates using Google Maps API
2. **get_weather** - Get the current weather for a location using PirateWeather API
3. **weather_lookup** - Combined tool that geocodes a location and fetches weather data

### GitHub Gist Tools

These tools allow the bot to fetch content from GitHub Gists, which are a simple way to share code snippets and text.

### Examples

```
!bot Fetch the code from this Gist: https://gist.github.com/username/abc123 and explain what it does
!bot List all the files in this Gist: https://gist.github.com/username/xyz789
```

### Available Tools

1. **fetch_gist** - Fetches content from a Gist URL
   - Parameters:
     - `gist_url` (string, required): URL of the GitHub Gist to fetch
     - `max_size` (number, optional): Maximum size in bytes to retrieve (default: 100000)
   - Features:
     - Supports both regular and raw Gist URLs
     - Works with single-file and multi-file Gists
     - Automatically fetches the raw content
     - Handles errors gracefully

2. **list_gist_files** - Lists all files in a multi-file Gist
   - Parameters:

- Provides detailed execution information

## User Facts Tools

These tools allow the bot to remember and recall facts about users in IRC channels, creating a memory of user information that can be referenced later.

!bot Tell me a random fact about someone
```
